# CS452 Project 1
Justin Mello
Spring 2025

# Overview
This is a C warmup project implementing a circular doubly linked list and using a sentinel node. It was also a brief introduction to using co-pilot to faciliate coding, and working with VSCode Workspaces in the cloud.

# Reflection
This was a great warmup project to help getting familiar with C again after a long periond of no C coding. Thankfully I wasn't too rusty! I also found using copilot to be interesting (it really was terrible with some things, but did great in other areas). It remains TBD on how much I will be able to rely on copilot for future projects.
